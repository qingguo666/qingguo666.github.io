I am Qing Guo, currently the fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (VT),
under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://xwdeng80.github.io" style="color:blue"><u>Xinwei Deng</u></a>.
I am also a memeber of VT Statistics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory <a href="https://www.sail.stat.vt.edu/" style="color:blue"><u>(VT-SAIL)</u></a>.
<br />
<br />
My research focuses on addressing some of the frontier fundamental challenges in machine learning using
novel mathematical and statistical insights. Specifically, my study covers the following topics:

* Nonparametric mutual information estimation with contrastive learning techniques
* Optimal Bayesian experimental design for both static and sequential models
* Meta-learning based on information-theoretic genralization theory
* Reasoning for conversational search and recommendation


## Education
* Ph.D. in Statistics, Virginia Tech, 2019-Present
* B.S. in Applied Statistics, Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, China, 2015-2019
