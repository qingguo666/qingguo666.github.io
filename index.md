I am Qing Guo, currently the fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (VT),
under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://xwdeng80.github.io" style="color:blue"><u>Xinwei Deng</u></a>.
I am also a memeber of VT Statistics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory <a href="https://www.sail.stat.vt.edu/" style="color:blue"><u>(VT-SAIL)</u></a>.
<br />
My research focuses on addressing some of the frontier fundamental challenges in machine learning using
novel mathematical and statistical insights. Specifically, my study covers the following topics:

* Nonparametric Contrastive Mutual Information Estimation
* Optimal Bayesian Experimental Design for both static and Sequential Models
* Meta-Learning based on Information Genralization Theory
* Reasoning in Conversation Search and Recommendation
