I am Qing Guo, currently the fourth-year PhD student at the Department of Statistics of Virginia Tech 
under the supervision of <a href="https://xwdeng80.github.io" style="color:blue"><u>Xinwei Deng</u></a>.
<br />
My research focuses on addressing some of the frontier fundamental challenges in machine learning using
novel mathematical and statistical insights. Specifically, my study covers the following topics:

* Nonparametric Contrastive Mutual Information Estimation
* Optimal Bayesian Experimental Design for both static and Sequential Models
* Meta-Learning based on Information Genralization Theory
* Reasoning in Conversation Search and Recommendation
